# Note:

:roll_eyes: Since this app is making use of free API's, some of the http requests are non-secure, which github pages doesn't support, therefore currently a live demo isn't available. 

:thumbsup: **Therefore** to see this app in action simply click the large green "code" button to your top right and download the .zip, unpack adn run the index.html file locally. You can even install it as a chrome extention! 

# About

This little app is a cool chrome extention dashboard based off of the momentum browser extention. I gave it a few other features like a currency converter.
