# dashBoard

This little app is a cool chrome extention based off of the momentum browser extention. I gave it a few other features like a currency converter.

# Note:

Since this app is making use of free API's, some of the requests are non-secure, which github pages doesn't support, thus I haven't currently got a live demo on line. 

**Therefore** please download the zip folder here under "code" and run the index.html file on your local browser.
